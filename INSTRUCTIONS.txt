Exercise:
Build a single page jQuery "app" that nicely (but simply) animates the display of a 5 day forecast given a single input box with expected input of city,state (I should be able to keep changing the city/state to get a new forecast).  

It should output for each day: the day of the week, the forecast for that day (text), a related graphic/icon tied to the forecast (e.g. rainy), the high and the low temp that day. You can use this free service to return forecast data (example call for Washington, DC):

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?q=Washington,dc&units=imperial&cnt=5

It should have simple user input validation/messaging, clean layout (you can use your favorite CSS/HTML library like Bootstrap or Foundation) and well structured code and error handling.  

Bonus points if it is also responsive and works down to a mobile phone browser. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any clarifications. Here are some links to info about the JSON format from the API and the icons used.

JSON format: http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Weather_Data

Forecast Data: http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Weather_Condition_Codes - For images, you can pull your own or use the ones fromhttp://openweathermap.org/img/w/<icon name returned in JSON icon>.png; so if icon is 03d then the URL to their matching image is http://openweathermap.org/img/w/03d.png)
